# Project: Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews
**`Developed and Deployed Sentiment Analysis Model Using Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM)`**
* Developed a `Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)` for sentiment analysis of movie reviews using the IMDB dataset.
* Utilized `Amazon SageMaker` to build, train, and optimize the RNN model.
* Deployed the model and created a web application that allows users to input movie reviews.
* The web application provides real-time sentiment predictions, classifying reviews as `Positive` or `Negative`.
